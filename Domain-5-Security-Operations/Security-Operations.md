# Domain 5: Security Operations

## Introduction

Security Operations (SecOps) is the largest domain in the ISC2 Certified in Cybersecurity exam, representing **30%** of the certification content. This domain focuses on the day-to-day activities that keep an organization's security posture strong and responsive to threats.

Security Operations encompasses the processes, tools, and techniques used to protect an organization's information systems and data. It involves continuous monitoring, incident detection and response, vulnerability management, and maintaining the overall security health of the organization.

*Domain D5.1.1, D5.1.2, D5.1.3*

### Data Handling

Data is one of the most critical assets of any organization. Proper data handling ensures that information remains secure throughout its lifecycle.

#### Data Lifecycle
1. **Creation**: Data is generated or acquired
2. **Storage**: Data is saved in databases, files, or other repositories
3. **Use**: Data is accessed and processed for business purposes
4. **Sharing**: Data may be transmitted to other parties
5. **Archiving**: Data is moved to long-term storage
6. **Destruction**: Data is securely deleted when no longer needed

#### Data Classifications
Organizations classify data based on its sensitivity and the impact of unauthorized disclosure:

* **Public**: Information that can be freely shared (e.g., marketing materials)
* **Internal**: Information intended for use within the organization
* **Confidential**: Sensitive information that could harm the organization if disclosed
* **Restricted/Top Secret**: Highly sensitive information requiring the highest level of protection

#### Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
DLP solutions monitor, detect, and block the unauthorized transmission of sensitive data. They can:
- Monitor email attachments for sensitive information
- Block USB port access to prevent data exfiltration
- Scan network traffic for confidential data patterns
- Watermark documents to track their distribution

### Logging and Monitoring Activities

#### Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
SIEM systems collect, aggregate, and analyze log data from various sources to:
- Detect security incidents in real-time
- Provide centralized visibility into security events
- Generate compliance reports
- Support forensic investigations

#### Log Sources
- **Network devices**: Firewalls, routers, switches
- **Security tools**: IDS/IPS, antivirus, DLP
- **Servers**: Operating system logs, application logs
- **Databases**: Access logs, query logs
