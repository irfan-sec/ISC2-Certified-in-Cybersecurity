ecrecy and Confidentiality
Question: The concept of ‚Äúsecrecy‚Äù is most related to which foundational aspect of security?

Availability

Confidentiality

Integrity

Plausibility

Answer: The concept of ‚Äúsecrecy‚Äù is most closely related to Confidentiality.

Explanation: Confidentiality is the principle that ensures information is accessible only to those authorized to view it. This directly aligns with the idea of keeping data secret from unauthorized parties.

Availability ensures that authorized users can access information when they need it.

Integrity ensures that information is accurate and protected from unauthorized modification.

Plausibility is not a foundational aspect of the standard CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) security triad.

üá™üá∫ Comprehensive Privacy Legislation
Question: Which region enacted comprehensive legislation addressing personal privacy in 2016?

United States

Asia-Pacific

European Union

Africa

Answer: The European Union (EU) enacted comprehensive legislation addressing personal privacy in 2016.

Explanation: In 2016, the EU adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became fully enforceable on May 25, 2018. GDPR is a landmark regulation that standardizes data protection law across all EU member states and imposes strict rules on organizations that handle personal data.

The United States has various sector-specific privacy laws (like HIPAA and COPPA) but lacks a single, comprehensive federal law similar to GDPR.

Privacy laws in the Asia-Pacific region and Africa vary by country; neither region has a unified, comprehensive law like the GDPR.

üõ°Ô∏è The Purpose of Security Controls
Question: What is the purpose of implementing security controls in the risk management process?

To eliminate all vulnerabilities

To ensure that a cyberattack would be impossible

To increase the level of risk

To mitigate the risk to an acceptable level

Answer: The purpose of implementing security controls is to mitigate the risk to an acceptable level.

Explanation: Risk management is a balancing act. It's understood that completely eliminating all vulnerabilities or making a cyberattack impossible is not a practical goal. Security controls are therefore used to reduce the likelihood and impact of threats to a level that the organization is willing to accept.

It is impossible to eliminate all vulnerabilities due to constantly evolving threats and system complexities.

No security system is perfect, so guaranteeing that a cyberattack is impossible is not realistic.

The goal is to reduce risk, not increase it.

üë£ Pickpockets and Attack Vectors
Question: If a pickpocket is a threat, what would be their attack vector?

Their technique and approach

The crowded tourist spot

Tourists

The stolen goods

Answer: The correct answer is their technique and approach.

Explanation: An attack vector is the specific method or path a threat uses to carry out an attack. For a pickpocket, their vector is how they steal‚Äîtheir methods of distraction, sleight of hand, and overall strategy.

The crowded tourist spot is the environment that enables the attack.

Tourists are the targets or victims.

The stolen goods are the assets being targeted.

üí∞ Managing Risk in Identity Theft Insurance
Question: How do companies that offer identity theft insurance manage their own financial risk?

By charging low premiums

By always honoring payout commitments

By calculating premium payments against potential payouts

By restricting the number of claims

Answer: Companies manage their financial risk by calculating premium payments against potential payouts.

Explanation: Insurance is fundamentally a business of risk management. These companies use actuarial data to forecast how many claims they're likely to receive and how much those claims will cost. They then set premium prices that are high enough to cover those expected payouts, cover operational costs, and generate a profit.

Low premiums might attract customers but could lead to financial losses if they don't cover the costs of claims.

Honoring payouts is an obligation, not a risk management strategy itself.

Restricting claims illegitimately is illegal; however, policies do have specific conditions and deductibles to define the scope of coverage.

üÜî Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
Question: What term is used to refer to information that, when combined with other pieces of data, significantly narrows the possibility of association with more individuals?

Personally Identifiable Information (PII)

Personal Identification Element (PIE)

Limited Access Data (LAD)

PII Fusion

Answer: The correct term is Personally Identifiable Information (PII).

Explanation: PII is any data that can be used to identify a specific individual. Some data, like a Social Security number, can identify someone on its own. Other data points, like a birth date, zip code, and gender, can be combined (or "fused") to single out an individual from a larger group.

Personal Identification Element (PIE), Limited Access Data (LAD), and PII Fusion are not standard industry terms for this concept.

üíª Risks of an Unattended Laptop
Question: What potential risk can occur when a remote worker‚Äôs laptop is left unattended or unlocked?

Corrupt workstation due to power outage

Mechanical failure of backup generators

Loss of internet connection

Accidental introduction of unauthorized software with malware

Answer: The primary risk is the accidental introduction of unauthorized software with malware.

Explanation: An unlocked and unattended laptop is an open invitation for unauthorized access. This creates several security risks, the most critical of which include:

Installation of malware: An unauthorized person could easily install malicious software, keyloggers, or ransomware.

Data theft: Sensitive company or personal data on the laptop could be copied or stolen.

Unauthorized system changes: A user could alter configurations, creating further vulnerabilities.

The other options are unrelated to the physical security of a laptop. Power outages, generator failures, and internet loss are operational or technical issues, not direct consequences of leaving a device unlocked.

‚öñÔ∏è The Information Security Code of Ethics
Question: According to the code of ethics, what are information security professionals expected to uphold?

Efficient and speedy decision-making

Be honorable, honest, just and responsible within legal conduct

Secrecy and confidentiality

Creativity and innovation

Answer: Information security professionals are expected to be honorable, honest, just, and responsible within legal conduct.

Explanation: The code of ethics for cybersecurity professionals (such as the one from (ISC)¬≤) serves as a foundational guide for professional conduct. The core tenets revolve around integrity and responsibility. This includes:

Acting honorably, honestly, justly, responsibly, and legally.

Providing diligent and competent service to principals.

Advancing and protecting the profession.
